# n8n-driven-content-hub

An automated content hub powered by n8n and Astro. This project automatically fetches information from various sources (like Hacker News, Reddit, YouTube, etc.) and publishes it as a static website.

## How It Works
This project uses a simple yet powerful automation pipeline to keep the content updated. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "External Services"
        A["Various Data Sources <br/>(HackerNews, Reddit, etc.)"]
    end

    subgraph "n8n Cloud / Server"
        B(n8n Workflow)
        B -- "1. Fetches & Formats Data" --> A
    end

    subgraph "GitHub"
        D["GitHub Action <br/> (on: repository_dispatch)"]
        E[src/content/reports/*.md]
        D -- "3. Creates & Commits Markdown File" --> E
    end
    
    subgraph "Hosting Platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)"
        F(Astro Build Process)
        G((Live Static Website))
    end

    B -- "2. Sends Webhook with content" --> D
    E -- "4. Git push triggers build" --> F
    F -- "5. Generates Static Pages" --> G

1. Fetch Data: An n8n Workflow runs on a schedule or is triggered to fetch new content from various APIs and RSS feeds.

2. Trigger Update: After collecting and formatting the data, n8n sends a webhook to the GitHub repository.

3. GitHub Action: This webhook triggers a GitHub Action which takes the payload (the formatted content) and creates a new Markdown file inside the src/content/reports/ directory.

4. Build & Deploy: The push of the new commit to the main branch automatically triggers a new build process on Cloudflare (you can also choose other static hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify).

5. Go Live: Astro builds the site, generating static HTML pages from the Markdown files, and the new content goes live.

## Tech Stack
- n8n: Used for data scraping and workflow automation.

- GitHub Actions: Handles CI/CD, receiving webhooks from n8n to automatically update the repository content.

- Astro: Powers the fast, content-driven static site.

- TypeScript: Ensures type safety throughout the project.

## Features
- Automated Content Updates: Content is updated automatically via n8n workflows without manual intervention.

- Dynamic Routing: Each report is automatically generated as a separate, unique page using Astro's file-based routing.

- Interactive UI: Supports filtering content by source (Tabs) and keyword searching.

- Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

- Dark Mode: Automatically adapts to your system's color scheme.
